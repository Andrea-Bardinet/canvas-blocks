Welcome to Canvas-block! ðŸ˜ƒ

You are in the tutorial, where you will find examples to get started with the environment.

## Programming

Here, programming is done using blocks! <br><br>
Each block describes a specific action to be performed. By combining these blocks, you can create more complex programs!

## Run your first program

Press the green "play" button and see what happens!

The background changes color, then text and a line are drawn.

## Explanation

Each block you see in your editor performs an action.

Let's start with the first block at the top of the stack:

This block sets the size (or resolution) of our canvas. This is defined in pixels.

This instruction waits for 1 second before moving on to the next one.

![sleep block img](blocks/sleep.png)

The rest of the instructions do what they say, namely consecutively:

- Fill an area with a chosen color
- Wait for 1 second
- Write text
- Wait for 1 second
- Draw a line
