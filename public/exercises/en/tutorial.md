# Welcome to Canvas-block! ðŸ˜ƒ

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on Canvas-block, a captivating visual programming environment! Here, you'll explore concrete examples to get acquainted with this unique tool.

## Visual Programming with Blocks

Canvas-block utilizes a visual programming approach where each action is represented by a block. By combining these blocks, you can create more complex programs without writing a single line of code!

## Running Your First Program

Take action by pressing the green "play" button and observe the results!

The canvas background will change color, text will appear, followed by a drawn line.

## Explanation of Blocks

Each block in your editor accomplishes a specific task. Let's break down the first block at the top of the stack:

This block sets the size (or resolution) of your canvas in pixels.

This instruction introduces a 1-second pause before moving to the next instruction.

The other blocks sequentially perform the following actions:
- Fill an area with a chosen color
- Wait for 1 second
- Write text
- Wait for 1 second
- Draw a line
